# 221H Lab 4

## DUE DATE
* Friday Feb 25 prior to lab (2 weeks).

## Objectives
* Become proficient with C++ STL associative containers
* Use STL containers to perform basic data science

## Reminder
* Update your Lab Fork, use these two commands:
```bash
  git pull
  git pull labs master
```
* Compiling with optimizations will be important for this lab, remember:
```bash
  g++ reddit_stats.cpp -o reddit_stats -O3
  # or g++-9 for our Mac Homebrew users
```

## Deliverables
* Start from reddit_stats.cpp that initially contains JSON parsing code to get you started.
* Design and fill the necessary C++ STL containers to answer the 10 questions listed at the end of the cpp file.
* Your data structures should store a sufficient amount of information to only parse the JSON data once.



## Rubric
* There are 10 questions listed at the bottom of reddit_stats.cpp.   Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 100 points.
* Commit and push your code to your private fork.
